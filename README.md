# Team Tada

We want to help reduce textile waste!

Why?

Because the fashion industry is the second-most polluting industry in the world! (Only behind oil)

We want to help consumers make more sustainable purchases.

It can be non-obvious what the right choice is. For example, cotton is biodegradable, but also requires a lot of water to produce!

Here is our initial data exploration of the water consumption for some materials:

Looking closer...

For more information, please take a look at our presentation: [Presentation](https://github.com/gridsusc/mindspark-1-team-tada/blob/main/Sustainable%20Shopper.pdf)
